# Algorithm Design Assignment 3

## Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing various algorithms in two main categories:
1. Dynamic Programming (Questions 1-5)
2. Greedy Algorithms and Minimum Spanning Trees (Questions 1-5)

## Problem Categories

### Part 1: Dynamic Programming
1. **Fair Coin Division**: Implement an algorithm to find the most fair division of coins between two people.
2. **Bug-ridden Message Decoder**: Calculate possible original strings given a message with character substitution rules.
3. **Bank Robbery Optimization**: Maximize stolen value given weight constraints using knapsack principles.
4. **Diver's Treasure**: Optimize treasure collection under time and depth constraints.
5. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a list.

### Part 2: Greedy Algorithms and MST
1. **Cookie Distribution**: Maximize the number of content children with cookie distribution.
2. **CPU Task Scheduling**: Minimize CPU intervals required to complete tasks with cooling periods.
3. **Path Validation**: Determine if a valid path exists between two vertices in a graph.
4. **Kingdom Road Security**: Calculate minimal cost to secure roads from bandits.
5. **HackerLand Distance**: Calculate sum of minimum distances between cities in binary.

## Technical Requirements
- Programming Language: C++
- Implementation should be submitted as separate CPP files for each question
- All solutions must handle the given constraints specified in each problem

## Input/Output Format
Each problem has specific input and output requirements. Please refer to the individual problem descriptions for detailed formatting requirements.


## Additional Notes
- All problems require careful consideration of edge cases
- Solutions should be optimized for the given constraints
- Code should be well-commented and properly formatted
- Test cases are provided for verification of solutions
